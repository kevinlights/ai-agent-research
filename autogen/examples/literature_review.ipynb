However, specifying their parameters (such as models, tools, and orchestration mechanisms etc,.) and debugging them remains challenging for most developers. To address this challenge, we present AUTOGEN STUDIO, a no-code developer tool for rapidly prototyping, debugging, and evaluating multi-agent workflows built upon the AUTOGEN framework. AUTOGEN STUDIO offers a web interface and a Python API for representing LLM-enabled agents using a declarative (JSON-based) specification. It provides an intuitive drag-and-drop UI for agent workflow specification, interactive evaluation and debugging of workflows, and a gallery of reusable agent components. We highlight four design principles for no-code multi-agent developer tools and contribute an open-source implementation at this https URL Comments: 8 pages Subjects: Software Engineering (cs.SE) ; Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Computation and Language (cs.CL); Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC); Machine Learning (cs.LG) Cite as: arXiv:2408.15247 [cs.SE] (or arXiv:2408.15247v1 [cs.SE] for this version) https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2408.15247 Focus to learn more arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite Submission history From: Victor Dibia [ view email ] [v1] Fri, 9 Aug 2024 03:27:37 UTC (5,057 KB) Full-text links: Access Paper: View a PDF of the paper titled AutoGen Studio: A No-Code Developer Tool for Building and Debugging Multi-Agent Systems, by Victor Dibia and 7 other authors View PDF HTML (experimental) TeX Source Other Formats view license Current browse context: cs.SE < prev | next > new | recent | 2024-08 Change to browse by: cs cs.AI cs.CL cs.HC cs.LG References & Citations NASA ADS Google Scholar Semantic Scholar a export BibTeX citation Loading...

We also explored the capabilities of the Semantic Kernel. For more details, check out this article: Unlock the Power of AI: Creating Your First AI Agent Using Semantic Kernel In this article, we’ll focus on getting started with the AutoGen framework. We’ll cover the basics, provide step-by-step instructions, and discuss how AutoGen can streamline the development of multi-agent systems. By the end, you’ll have a solid foundation to build your own multi-agent applications using AutoGen. Table of Contents Toggle Multi-agent orchestration frameworks What is AutoGen?

Prerequisites: OpenAI Configuration Details Creating your First Agent workflow in AutoGen, using AutoGen Studio Steps: Running the Program: Scenario 1: Scenario 2: Flow Explanation Take aways Conclusion What’s Next? Multi-agent orchestration frameworks To get started with AutoGen , let’s first recap the Orchestration Framework, its necessity, and other relevant details. Refer to my previous post Unlock the Power of AI: Creating Your First AI Agent Using Semantic Kernel to understand what an AI Agent is, what Multi-Agent systems are, and how to get started with Azure AI Agent services. Once you review that, you’ll grasp the need for an Orchestration layer and how Azure AI Agent Service integrates seamlessly with multi-agent orchestration frameworks compatible with the Assistants API, such as AutoGen and Semantic Kernel. It’s recommended to start by building reliable and secure singleton agents with Azure AI Agent Service . Then, orchestrate these agents using AutoGen , which evolves to find optimal collaboration patterns. Features that prove valuable in production with AutoGen can be transitioned to Semantic Kernel for stable, production-ready support. Now, let’s shift our focus to AutoGen , a framework crafted to identify optimal collaboration patterns and stimulate ideation. What is AutoGen? AutoGen is an advanced framework designed for creating multi-agent AI applications that can operate autonomously or in collaboration with humans. This innovative tool simplifies the development of complex multi-agent conversation systems through two main steps: Defining Agents : Users can specify a set of agents, each with specialized capabilities and roles tailored to specific tasks. Interaction Behavior : Users can define how these agents interact with one another, determining the appropriate responses when an agent receives messages from another. These steps are both intuitive and modular, allowing for the reuse and composition of agents across different applications. Code Generation, Execution, and Debugging: For instance, in building a system for code-based question answering, one can design agents and their interactions as illustrated in the image below. Example Workflow The above image demonstrates a workflow addressing code-based question answering within supply-chain optimization: Commander : Receives user questions and coordinates with other agents. Writer : Crafts the necessary code and provides interpretations. Safeguard : Ensures safety protocols are followed before execution. The process involves multiple interactions: The user submits a question to the Commander. The Commander logs the question and forwards it to the Writer. The Writer generates code based on the question. The Safeguard reviews the code for safety clearance. Upon clearance, the Commander executes the code and provides an answer to the user. This cycle repeats until a satisfactory answer is provided or a timeout occurs.

However, it might not be immediately clear when to switch to multi-agents and what the advantages are. Introduction In this lesson, we’re looking to answer the following questions: What are the scenarios where multi-agents are applicable to? What are the advantages of using multi-agents over just one singular agent doing multiple tasks? What are the building blocks of implementing the multi-agent design pattern? How do we have visibility to how the multiple agents are interacting with each other Learning Goals After this lesson, you should be able to: Identify scenarios where multi-agents are applicable Recognize the advantages of using multi-agents over a singular agent. Comprehend the building blocks of implementing the multi-agent design pattern. What’s the bigger picture? Multi agents are a design pattern that allows multiple agents to work together to achieve a common goal . This pattern is widely used in various fields, including robotics, autonomous systems, and distributed computing. Scenarios Where Multi-Agents Are Applicable So what scenarios are a good use case for using multi-agents? The answer is that there are many scenarios where employing multiple agents is beneficial especially in the following cases: Large workloads : Large workloads can be divided into smaller tasks and assigned to different agents, allowing for parallel processing and faster completion. An example of this is in the case of a large data processing task. Complex tasks : Complex tasks, like large workloads, can be broken down into smaller subtasks and assigned to different agents, each specializing in a specific aspect of the task. A good example of this is in the case of autonomous vehicles where different agents manage navigation, obstacle detection, and communication with other vehicles. Diverse expertise : Different agents can have diverse expertise, allowing them to handle different aspects of a task more effectively than a single agent. For this case, a good example is in the case of healthcare where agents can manage diagnostics, treatment plans, and patient monitoring. Advantages of Using Multi-Agents Over a Singular Agent A single agent system could work well for simple tasks, but for more complex tasks, using multiple agents can provide several advantages: Specialization : Each agent can be specialized for a specific task. Lack of specialization in a single agent means you have an agent that can do everything but might get confused on what to do when faced with a complex task. It might for example end up doing a task that it is not best suited for. Scalability : It is easier to scale systems by adding more agents rather than overloading a single agent. Fault Tolerance : If one agent fails, others can continue functioning, ensuring system reliability. Let’s take an example, let’s book a trip for a user. A single agent system would have to handle all aspects of the trip booking process, from finding flights to booking hotels and rental cars. To achieve this with a single agent, the agent would need to have tools for handling all these tasks. This could lead to a complex and monolithic system that is difficult to maintain and scale. A multi-agent system, on the other hand, could have different agents specialized in finding flights, booking hotels, and rental cars. This would make the system more modular, easier to maintain, and scalable. Compare this to a travel bureau run as a mom and pop store versus a travel bureau run as a franchise. The mom and pop store would have a single agent handling all aspects of the trip booking process, while the franchise would have different agents handling different aspects of the trip booking process. Building Blocks of Implementing the Multi-Agent Design Pattern Before you can implement the multi-agent design pattern, you need to understand the building blocks that make up the pattern. Let’s make this more concrete by again looking at the example of booking a trip for a user. In this case, the building blocks would include: Agent Communication : Agents for finding flights, booking hotels, and rental cars need to communicate and share information about the user’s preferences and constraints. You need to decide on the protocols and methods for this communication. What this means concretely is that the agent for finding flights needs to communicate with the agent for booking hotels to ensure that the hotel is booked for the same dates as the flight. That means that the agents need to share information about the user’s travel dates, meaning that you need to decide which agents are sharing info and how they are sharing info . Coordination Mechanisms : Agents need to coordinate their actions to ensure that the user’s preferences and constraints are met. A user preference could be that they want a hotel close to the airport whereas a constraint could be that rental cars are only available at the airport. This means that the agent for booking hotels needs to coordinate with the agent for booking rental cars to ensure that the user’s preferences and constraints are met. This means that you need to decide how the agents are coordinating their actions . Agent Architecture : Agents need to have the internal structure to make decisions and learn from their interactions with the user. This means that the agent for finding flights needs to have the internal structure to make decisions about which flights to recommend to the user. This means that you need to decide how the agents are making decisions and learning from their interactions with the user . Examples of how an agent learns and improves could be that the agent for finding flights could use a machine learning model to recommend flights to the user based on their past preferences. Visibility into Multi-Agent Interactions : You need to have visibility into how the multiple agents are interacting with each other. This means that you need to have tools and techniques for tracking agent activities and interactions. This could be in the form of logging and monitoring tools, visualization tools, and performance metrics. Multi-Agent Patterns : There are different patterns for implementing multi-agent systems, such as centralized, decentralized, and hybrid architectures. You need to decide on the pattern that best fits your use case. Human in the loop : In most cases, you will have a human in the loop and you need to instruct the agents when to ask for human intervention. This could be in the form of a user asking for a specific hotel or flight that the agents have not recommended or asking for confirmation before booking a flight or hotel. Visibility into Multi-Agent Interactions It’s important that you have visibility into how the multiple agents are interacting with each other. This visibility is essential for debugging, optimizing, and ensuring the overall system’s effectiveness. To achieve this, you need to have tools and techniques for tracking agent activities and interactions. This could be in the form of logging and monitoring tools, visualization tools, and performance metrics. For example, in the case of booking a trip for a user, you could have a dashboard that shows the status of each agent, the user’s preferences and constraints, and the interactions between agents. This dashboard could show the user’s travel dates, the flights recommended by the flight agent, the hotels recommended by the hotel agent, and the rental cars recommended by the rental car agent. This would give you a clear view of how the agents are interacting with each other and whether the user’s preferences and constraints are being met. Let’s look at each of these aspects more in detail. Logging and Monitoring Tools : You want to have logging done for each action taken by an agent. A log entry could store information on the agent that took the action, the action taken, the time the action was taken, and the outcome of the action. This information can then be used for debugging, optimizing and more. Visualization Tools : Visualization tools can help you see the interactions between agents in a more intuitive way. For example, you could have a graph that shows the flow of information between agents. This could help you identify bottlenecks, inefficiencies, and other issues in the system. Performance Metrics : Performance metrics can help you track the effectiveness of the multi-agent system. For example, you could track the time taken to complete a task, the number of tasks completed per unit of time, and the accuracy of the recommendations made by the agents. This information can help you identify areas for improvement and optimize the system. Multi-Agent Patterns Let’s dive into some concrete patterns we can use to create multi-agent apps. Here are some interesting patterns worth considering: Group chat This pattern is useful when you want to create a group chat application where multiple agents can communicate with each other. Typical use cases for this pattern include team collaboration, customer support, and social networking. In this pattern, each agent represents a user in the group chat, and messages are exchanged between agents using a messaging protocol. The agents can send messages to the group chat, receive messages from the group chat, and respond to messages from other agents. This pattern can be implemented using a centralized architecture where all messages are routed through a central server, or a decentralized architecture where messages are exchanged directly. Hand-off This pattern is useful when you want to create an application where multiple agents can hand off tasks to each other. Typical use cases for this pattern include customer support, task management, and workflow automation. In this pattern, each agent\\'}, {\\'title\\': \\'Introducing multiagent BeeAI - IBM Research\\', \\'link\\': \\'https://research.ibm.com/blog/multiagent-bee-ai\\', \\'snippet\\': \\'1 天前\\\\u2002·\\\\u2002BeeAI is aimed at making it easy for developers to run popular open-source AI agents from different frameworks and build specialized agents of their own.

If two heads are better than one, imagine what you could do with a dozen or more. That’s the inspiration behind IBM Research’s newly redesigned multiagent experimental platform, Bee AI . BeeAI is aimed at making it easy for developers to run popular open-source AI agents from different frameworks and build specialized agents of their own. No matter where the agents originated, or what code they were written in, they can be easily configured to work alone, or with AI teammates, through the IBM Research-designed agent communication protocol (ACP). The ACP standardizes how agents talk to each other, removing one of the main barriers to developing multiagent systems . “Right now, agent-to-agent communication is challenged by inconsistent agent interfaces,” said Kate Blair, the director of product incubation at IBM Research who oversees BeeAI. “ACP will act like a universal connector, providing a standardized way for them to exchange information and interact with other systems.\" The initial BeeAI experiment was geared toward business users, but BeeAI was revamped earlier this year to focus on developers. Its new goal is to streamline the process of finding, integrating, and orchestrating AI agents, no matter which framework or programming language those agents were built in. The protocol underlying BeeAI that makes this all possible is built on Anthropic’s model communication protocol (MCP). Introduced last November, the MCP has standardized how agents connect to tools and data to interact with and accomplish tasks in the real world. IBM’s ACP takes things a step further by introducing the ability to discover and run agents. ACP is currently in the “pre-alpha” stage, as IBM researchers rally the open-source community to build out the protocol to make it easier to discover agents, delegate tasks, and improve agent-to-agent operability. ACP is expected to soon be independent of MCP. Through BeeAI, users can try out some of the most popular open-source agents on the Web with two commands in the command line interface or a click in the UI. Current offerings include widely used open-source agents like Aider , a pair programmer for editing code, and GPT-Researcher , an agent for gathering and organizing research and citations. There’s even an agent for turning research into structured podcasts optimized for AI-driven text-to-speech to dialogue. On Friday, Blair showed off BeeAI at the AI Dev 25 conference in San Francisco with Ismael Faro, distinguished engineer at quantum and AI at IBM Research. Hosted by Coursera and DeepLearning.AI founder, Andrew Ng, the conference draws hundreds of developers each year. “We want to open the discussion, and help move the community toward a universal standard,” said Faro. “We also want to take a feature-driven approach.” Check out the project on GitHub and read the draft ACP proposal .

However, specifying their parameters (such as models, tools, and orchestration mechanisms etc,.) and debugging them remains challenging for most developers. To address this challenge, we present AUTOGEN STUDIO, a no-code developer tool for rapidly prototyping, debugging, and evaluating multi-agent workflows built upon the AUTOGEN framework. AUTOGEN STUDIO offers a web interface and a Python API for representing LLM-enabled agents using a declarative (JSON-based) specification. It provides an intuitive drag-and-drop UI for agent workflow specification, interactive evaluation and debugging of workflows, and a gallery of reusable agent components. We highlight four design principles for no-code multi-agent developer tools and contribute an open-source implementation at this https URL Comments: 8 pages Subjects: Software Engineering (cs.SE) ; Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Computation and Language (cs.CL); Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC); Machine Learning (cs.LG) Cite as: arXiv:2408.15247 [cs.SE] (or arXiv:2408.15247v1 [cs.SE] for this version) https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2408.15247 Focus to learn more arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite Submission history From: Victor Dibia [ view email ] [v1] Fri, 9 Aug 2024 03:27:37 UTC (5,057 KB) Full-text links: Access Paper: View a PDF of the paper titled AutoGen Studio: A No-Code Developer Tool for Building and Debugging Multi-Agent Systems, by Victor Dibia and 7 other authors View PDF HTML (experimental) TeX Source Other Formats view license Current browse context: cs.SE < prev | next > new | recent | 2024-08 Change to browse by: cs cs.AI cs.CL cs.HC cs.LG References & Citations NASA ADS Google Scholar Semantic Scholar a export BibTeX citation Loading...

Multi-agent orchestration frameworks To get started with AutoGen , let’s first recap the Orchestration Framework, its necessity, and other relevant details. Refer to my previous post Unlock the Power of AI: Creating Your First AI Agent Using Semantic Kernel to understand what an AI Agent is, what Multi-Agent systems are, and how to get started with Azure AI Agent services. Once you review that, you’ll grasp the need for an Orchestration layer and how Azure AI Agent Service integrates seamlessly with multi-agent orchestration frameworks compatible with the Assistants API, such as AutoGen and Semantic Kernel. It’s recommended to start by building reliable and secure singleton agents with Azure AI Agent Service . Then, orchestrate these agents using AutoGen , which evolves to find optimal collaboration patterns. Features that prove valuable in production with AutoGen can be transitioned to Semantic Kernel for stable, production-ready support. Now, let’s shift our focus to AutoGen , a framework crafted to identify optimal collaboration patterns and stimulate ideation. What is AutoGen? AutoGen is an advanced framework designed for creating multi-agent AI applications that can operate autonomously or in collaboration with humans. This innovative tool simplifies the development of complex multi-agent conversation systems through two main steps: Defining Agents : Users can specify a set of agents, each with specialized capabilities and roles tailored to specific tasks. Interaction Behavior : Users can define how these agents interact with one another, determining the appropriate responses when an agent receives messages from another. These steps are both intuitive and modular, allowing for the reuse and composition of agents across different applications. Code Generation, Execution, and Debugging: For instance, in building a system for code-based question answering, one can design agents and their interactions as illustrated in the image below. Example Workflow The above image demonstrates a workflow addressing code-based question answering within supply-chain optimization: Commander : Receives user questions and coordinates with other agents. Writer : Crafts the necessary code and provides interpretations. Safeguard : Ensures safety protocols are followed before execution. The process involves multiple interactions: The user submits a question to the Commander. The Commander logs the question and forwards it to the Writer. The Writer generates code based on the question. The Safeguard reviews the code for safety clearance. Upon clearance, the Commander executes the code and provides an answer to the user. This cycle repeats until a satisfactory answer is provided or a timeout occurs. Benefits Using AutoGen significantly reduces manual interactions—by up to 10 times—and coding effort by more than fourfold in applications such as supply-chain optimization. By leveraging AutoGen, developers can efficiently build sophisticated AI systems that enhance productivity while ensuring safety and reliability in their operations.

However, it might not be immediately clear when to switch to multi-agents and what the advantages are. Introduction In this lesson, we’re looking to answer the following questions: What are the scenarios where multi-agents are applicable to? What are the advantages of using multi-agents over just one singular agent doing multiple tasks? What are the building blocks of implementing the multi-agent design pattern? How do we have visibility to how the multiple agents are interacting with each other Learning Goals After this lesson, you should be able to: Identify scenarios where multi-agents are applicable Recognize the advantages of using multi-agents over a singular agent. Comprehend the building blocks of implementing the multi-agent design pattern. What’s the bigger picture? Multi agents are a design pattern that allows multiple agents to work together to achieve a common goal . This pattern is widely used in various fields, including robotics, autonomous systems, and distributed computing. Scenarios Where Multi-Agents Are Applicable So what scenarios are a good use case for using multi-agents? The answer is that there are many scenarios where employing multiple agents is beneficial especially in the following cases: Large workloads : Large workloads can be divided into smaller tasks and assigned to different agents, allowing for parallel processing and faster completion. An example of this is in the case of a large data processing task. Complex tasks : Complex tasks, like large workloads, can be broken down into smaller subtasks and assigned to different agents, each specializing in a specific aspect of the task. A good example of this is in the case of autonomous vehicles where different agents manage navigation, obstacle detection, and communication with other vehicles. Diverse expertise : Different agents can have diverse expertise, allowing them to handle different aspects of a task more effectively than a single agent. For this case, a good example is in the case of healthcare where agents can manage diagnostics, treatment plans, and patient monitoring. Advantages of Using Multi-Agents Over a Singular Agent A single agent system could work well for simple tasks, but for more complex tasks, using multiple agents can provide several advantages: Specialization : Each agent can be specialized for a specific task. Lack of specialization in a single agent means you have an agent that can do everything but might get confused on what to do when faced with a complex task. It might for example end up doing a task that it is not best suited for. Scalability : It is easier to scale systems by adding more agents rather than overloading a single agent. Fault Tolerance : If one agent fails, others can continue functioning, ensuring system reliability. Let’s take an example, let’s book a trip for a user. A single agent system would have to handle all aspects of the trip booking process, from finding flights to booking hotels and rental cars. To achieve this with a single agent, the agent would need to have tools for handling all these tasks. This could lead to a complex and monolithic system that is difficult to maintain and scale. A multi-agent system, on the other hand, could have different agents specialized in finding flights, booking hotels, and rental cars. This would make the system more modular, easier to maintain, and scalable. Compare this to a travel bureau run as a mom and pop store versus a travel bureau run as a franchise. The mom and pop store would have a single agent handling all aspects of the trip booking process, while the franchise would have different agents handling different aspects of the trip booking process. Building Blocks of Implementing the Multi-Agent Design Pattern Before you can implement the multi-agent design pattern, you need to understand the building blocks that make up the pattern. Let’s make this more concrete by again looking at the example of booking a trip for a user. In this case, the building blocks would include: Agent Communication : Agents for finding flights, booking hotels, and rental cars need to communicate and share information about the user’s preferences and constraints. You need to decide on the protocols and methods for this communication. What this means concretely is that the agent for finding flights needs to communicate with the agent for booking hotels to ensure that the hotel is booked for the same dates as the flight. That means that the agents need to share information about the user’s travel dates, meaning that you need to decide which agents are sharing info and how they are sharing info . Coordination Mechanisms : Agents need to coordinate their actions to ensure that the user’s preferences and constraints are met. A user preference could be that they want a hotel close to the airport whereas a constraint could be that rental cars are only available at the airport. This means that the agent for booking hotels needs to coordinate with the agent for booking rental cars to ensure that the user’s preferences and constraints are met. This means that you need to decide how the agents are coordinating their actions . Agent Architecture : Agents need to have the internal structure to make decisions and learn from their interactions with the user. This means that the agent for finding flights needs to have the internal structure to make decisions about which flights to recommend to the user. This means that you need to decide how the agents are making decisions and learning from their interactions with the user . Examples of how an agent learns and improves could be that the agent for finding flights could use a machine learning model to recommend flights to the user based on their past preferences. Visibility into Multi-Agent Interactions : You need to have visibility into how the multiple agents are interacting with each other. This means that you need to have tools and techniques for tracking agent activities and interactions. This could be in the form of logging and monitoring tools, visualization tools, and performance metrics. Multi-Agent Patterns : There are different patterns for implementing multi-agent systems, such as centralized, decentralized, and hybrid architectures. You need to decide on the pattern that best fits your use case. Human in the loop : In most cases, you will have a human in the loop and you need to instruct the agents when to ask for human intervention. This could be in the form of a user asking for a specific hotel or flight that the agents have not recommended or asking for confirmation before booking a flight or hotel. Visibility into Multi-Agent Interactions It’s important that you have visibility into how the multiple agents are interacting with each other. This visibility is essential for debugging, optimizing, and ensuring the overall system’s effectiveness. To achieve this, you need to have tools and techniques for tracking agent activities and interactions. This could be in the form of logging and monitoring tools, visualization tools, and performance metrics. For example, in the case of booking a trip for a user, you could have a dashboard that shows the status of each agent, the user’s preferences and constraints, and the interactions between agents. This dashboard could show the user’s travel dates, the flights recommended by the flight agent, the hotels recommended by the hotel agent, and the rental cars recommended by the rental car agent. This would give you a clear view of how the agents are interacting with each other and whether the user’s preferences and constraints are being met. Let’s look at each of these aspects more in detail. Logging and Monitoring Tools : You want to have logging done for each action taken by an agent. A log entry could store information on the agent that took the action, the action taken, the time the action was taken, and the outcome of the action. This information can then be used for debugging, optimizing and more. Visualization Tools : Visualization tools can help you see the interactions between agents in a more intuitive way. For example, you could have a graph that shows the flow of information between agents. This could help you identify bottlenecks, inefficiencies, and other issues in the system. Performance Metrics : Performance metrics can help you track the effectiveness of the multi-agent system. For example, you could track the time taken to complete a task, the number of tasks completed per unit of time, and the accuracy of the recommendations made by the agents. This information can help you identify areas for improvement and optimize the system. Multi-Agent Patterns Let’s dive into some concrete patterns we can use to create multi-agent apps. Here are some interesting patterns worth considering: Group chat This pattern is useful when you want to create a group chat application where multiple agents can communicate with each other. Typical use cases for this pattern include team collaboration, customer support, and social networking. In this pattern, each agent represents a user in the group chat, and messages are exchanged between agents using a messaging protocol. The agents can send messages to the group chat, receive messages from the group chat, and respond to messages from other agents. This pattern can be implemented using a centralized architecture where all messages are routed through a central server, or a decentralized architecture where messages are exchanged directly. Hand-off This pattern is useful when you want to create an application where multiple agents can hand off tasks to each other. Typical use cases for this pattern include customer support, task management, and workflow automation. In this pattern, each agent'}, {'title': 'Introducing multiagent BeeAI - IBM Research', 'link': 'https://research.ibm.com/blog/multiagent-bee-ai', 'snippet': '1 天前\\u2002·\\u2002BeeAI is aimed at making it easy for developers to run popular open-source AI agents from different frameworks and build specialized agents of their own.

If two heads are better than one, imagine what you could do with a dozen or more. That’s the inspiration behind IBM Research’s newly redesigned multiagent experimental platform, Bee AI . BeeAI is aimed at making it easy for developers to run popular open-source AI agents from different frameworks and build specialized agents of their own. No matter where the agents originated, or what code they were written in, they can be easily configured to work alone, or with AI teammates, through the IBM Research-designed agent communication protocol (ACP). The ACP standardizes how agents talk to each other, removing one of the main barriers to developing multiagent systems . “Right now, agent-to-agent communication is challenged by inconsistent agent interfaces,” said Kate Blair, the director of product incubation at IBM Research who oversees BeeAI. “ACP will act like a universal connector, providing a standardized way for them to exchange information and interact with other systems.\" The initial BeeAI experiment was geared toward business users, but BeeAI was revamped earlier this year to focus on developers. Its new goal is to streamline the process of finding, integrating, and orchestrating AI agents, no matter which framework or programming language those agents were built in. The protocol underlying BeeAI that makes this all possible is built on Anthropic’s model communication protocol (MCP). Introduced last November, the MCP has standardized how agents connect to tools and data to interact with and accomplish tasks in the real world. IBM’s ACP takes things a step further by introducing the ability to discover and run agents. ACP is currently in the “pre-alpha” stage, as IBM researchers rally the open-source community to build out the protocol to make it easier to discover agents, delegate tasks, and improve agent-to-agent operability. ACP is expected to soon be independent of MCP. Through BeeAI, users can try out some of the most popular open-source agents on the Web with two commands in the command line interface or a click in the UI. Current offerings include widely used open-source agents like Aider , a pair programmer for editing code, and GPT-Researcher , an agent for gathering and organizing research and citations. There’s even an agent for turning research into structured podcasts optimized for AI-driven text-to-speech to dialogue. On Friday, Blair showed off BeeAI at the AI Dev 25 conference in San Francisco with Ismael Faro, distinguished engineer at quantum and AI at IBM Research. Hosted by Coursera and DeepLearning.AI founder, Andrew Ng, the conference draws hundreds of developers each year. “We want to open the discussion, and help move the community toward a universal standard,” said Faro. “We also want to take a feature-driven approach.” Check out the project on GitHub and read the draft ACP proposal .

AUTOGEN STUDIO offers a web interface and a Python API for representing LLM-enabled agents using a declarative (JSON-based) specification.

Multi-agent orchestration frameworks To get started with AutoGen , let’s first recap the Orchestration Framework, its necessity, and other relevant details. Refer to my previous post Unlock the Power of AI: Creating Your First AI Agent Using Semantic Kernel to understand what an AI Agent is, what Multi-Agent systems are, and how to get started with Azure AI Agent services. Once you review that, you’ll grasp the need for an Orchestration layer and how Azure AI Agent Service integrates seamlessly with multi-agent orchestration frameworks compatible with the Assistants API, such as AutoGen and Semantic Kernel. It’s recommended to start by building reliable and secure singleton agents with Azure AI Agent Service . Then, orchestrate these agents using AutoGen , which evolves to find optimal collaboration patterns. Features that prove valuable in production with AutoGen can be transitioned to Semantic Kernel for stable, production-ready support. Now, let’s shift our focus to AutoGen , a framework crafted to identify optimal collaboration patterns and stimulate ideation. What is AutoGen? AutoGen is an advanced framework designed for creating multi-agent AI applications that can operate autonomously or in collaboration with humans. This innovative tool simplifies the development of complex multi-agent conversation systems through two main steps: Defining Agents : Users can specify a set of agents, each with specialized capabilities and roles tailored to specific tasks. Interaction Behavior : Users can define how these agents interact with one another, determining the appropriate responses when an agent receives messages from another. These steps are both intuitive and modular, allowing for the reuse and composition of agents across different applications. Code Generation, Execution, and Debugging: For instance, in building a system for code-based question answering, one can design agents and their interactions as illustrated in the image below. Example Workflow The above image demonstrates a workflow addressing code-based question answering within supply-chain optimization: Commander : Receives user questions and coordinates with other agents. Writer : Crafts the necessary code and provides interpretations. Safeguard : Ensures safety protocols are followed before execution. The process involves multiple interactions: The user submits a question to the Commander. The Commander logs the question and forwards it to the Writer. The Writer generates code based on the question. The Safeguard reviews the code for safety clearance. Upon clearance, the Commander executes the code and provides an answer to the user. This cycle repeats until a satisfactory answer is provided or a timeout occurs. Benefits Using AutoGen significantly reduces manual interactions—by up to 10 times—and coding effort by more than fourfold in applications such as supply-chain optimization. By leveraging AutoGen, developers can efficiently build sophisticated AI systems that enhance productivity while ensuring safety and reliability in their operations.

However, it might not be immediately clear when to switch to multi-agents and what the advantages are. Introduction In this lesson, we’re looking to answer the following questions: What are the scenarios where multi-agents are applicable to? What are the advantages of using multi-agents over just one singular agent doing multiple tasks? What are the building blocks of implementing the multi-agent design pattern? How do we have visibility to how the multiple agents are interacting with each other Learning Goals After this lesson, you should be able to: Identify scenarios where multi-agents are applicable Recognize the advantages of using multi-agents over a singular agent. Comprehend the building blocks of implementing the multi-agent design pattern. What’s the bigger picture? Multi agents are a design pattern that allows multiple agents to work together to achieve a common goal . This pattern is widely used in various fields, including robotics, autonomous systems, and distributed computing. Scenarios Where Multi-Agents Are Applicable So what scenarios are a good use case for using multi-agents? The answer is that there are many scenarios where employing multiple agents is beneficial especially in the following cases: Large workloads : Large workloads can be divided into smaller tasks and assigned to different agents, allowing for parallel processing and faster completion. An example of this is in the case of a large data processing task. Complex tasks : Complex tasks, like large workloads, can be broken down into smaller subtasks and assigned to different agents, each specializing in a specific aspect of the task. A good example of this is in the case of autonomous vehicles where different agents manage navigation, obstacle detection, and communication with other vehicles. Diverse expertise : Different agents can have diverse expertise, allowing them to handle different aspects of a task more effectively than a single agent. For this case, a good example is in the case of healthcare where agents can manage diagnostics, treatment plans, and patient monitoring. Advantages of Using Multi-Agents Over a Singular Agent A single agent system could work well for simple tasks, but for more complex tasks, using multiple agents can provide several advantages: Specialization : Each agent can be specialized for a specific task. Lack of specialization in a single agent means you have an agent that can do everything but might get confused on what to do when faced with a complex task. It might for example end up doing a task that it is not best suited for. Scalability : It is easier to scale systems by adding more agents rather than overloading a single agent. Fault Tolerance : If one agent fails, others can continue functioning, ensuring system reliability. Let’s take an example, let’s book a trip for a user. A single agent system would have to handle all aspects of the trip booking process, from finding flights to booking hotels and rental cars. To achieve this with a single agent, the agent would need to have tools for handling all these tasks. This could lead to a complex and monolithic system that is difficult to maintain and scale. A multi-agent system, on the other hand, could have different agents specialized in finding flights, booking hotels, and rental cars. This would make the system more modular, easier to maintain, and scalable. Compare this to a travel bureau run as a mom and pop store versus a travel bureau run as a franchise. The mom and pop store would have a single agent handling all aspects of the trip booking process, while the franchise would have different agents handling different aspects of the trip booking process. Building Blocks of Implementing the Multi-Agent Design Pattern Before you can implement the multi-agent design pattern, you need to understand the building blocks that make up the pattern. Let’s make this more concrete by again looking at the example of booking a trip for a user. In this case, the building blocks would include: Agent Communication : Agents for finding flights, booking hotels, and rental cars need to communicate and share information about the user’s preferences and constraints. You need to decide on the protocols and methods for this communication. What this means concretely is that the agent for finding flights needs to communicate with the agent for booking hotels to ensure that the hotel is booked for the same dates as the flight. That means that the agents need to share information about the user’s travel dates, meaning that you need to decide which agents are sharing info and how they are sharing info . Coordination Mechanisms : Agents need to coordinate their actions to ensure that the user’s preferences and constraints are met. A user preference could be that they want a hotel close to the airport whereas a constraint could be that rental cars are only available at the airport. This means that the agent for booking hotels needs to coordinate with the agent for booking rental cars to ensure that the user’s preferences and constraints are met. This means that you need to decide how the agents are coordinating their actions . Agent Architecture : Agents need to have the internal structure to make decisions and learn from their interactions with the user. This means that the agent for finding flights needs to have the internal structure to make decisions about which flights to recommend to the user. This means that you need to decide how the agents are making decisions and learning from their interactions with the user . Examples of how an agent learns and improves could be that the agent for finding flights could use a machine learning model to recommend flights to the user based on their past preferences. Visibility into Multi-Agent Interactions : You need to have visibility into how the multiple agents are interacting with each other. This means that you need to have tools and techniques for tracking agent activities and interactions. This could be in the form of logging and monitoring tools, visualization tools, and performance metrics. Multi-Agent Patterns : There are different patterns for implementing multi-agent systems, such as centralized, decentralized, and hybrid architectures. You need to decide on the pattern that best fits your use case. Human in the loop : In most cases, you will have a human in the loop and you need to instruct the agents when to ask for human intervention. This could be in the form of a user asking for a specific hotel or flight that the agents have not recommended or asking for confirmation before booking a flight or hotel. Visibility into Multi-Agent Interactions It’s important that you have visibility into how the multiple agents are interacting with each other. This visibility is essential for debugging, optimizing, and ensuring the overall system’s effectiveness. To achieve this, you need to have tools and techniques for tracking agent activities and interactions. This could be in the form of logging and monitoring tools, visualization tools, and performance metrics. For example, in the case of booking a trip for a user, you could have a dashboard that shows the status of each agent, the user’s preferences and constraints, and the interactions between agents. This dashboard could show the user’s travel dates, the flights recommended by the flight agent, the hotels recommended by the hotel agent, and the rental cars recommended by the rental car agent. This would give you a clear view of how the agents are interacting with each other and whether the user’s preferences and constraints are being met. Let’s look at each of these aspects more in detail. Logging and Monitoring Tools : You want to have logging done for each action taken by an agent. A log entry could store information on the agent that took the action, the action taken, the time the action was taken, and the outcome of the action. This information can then be used for debugging, optimizing and more. Visualization Tools : Visualization tools can help you see the interactions between agents in a more intuitive way. For example, you could have a graph that shows the flow of information between agents. This could help you identify bottlenecks, inefficiencies, and other issues in the system. Performance Metrics : Performance metrics can help you track the effectiveness of the multi-agent system. For example, you could track the time taken to complete a task, the number of tasks completed per unit of time, and the accuracy of the recommendations made by the agents. This information can help you identify areas for improvement and optimize the system. Multi-Agent Patterns Let’s dive into some concrete patterns we can use to create multi-agent apps. Here are some interesting patterns worth considering: Group chat This pattern is useful when you want to create a group chat application where multiple agents can communicate with each other. Typical use cases for this pattern include team collaboration, customer support, and social networking. In this pattern, each agent represents a user in the group chat, and messages are exchanged between agents using a messaging protocol. The agents can send messages to the group chat, receive messages from the group chat, and respond to messages from other agents. This pattern can be implemented using a centralized architecture where all messages are routed through a central server, or a decentralized architecture where messages are exchanged directly.

If two heads are better than one, imagine what you could do with a dozen or more. That’s the inspiration behind IBM Research’s newly redesigned multiagent experimental platform, Bee AI . BeeAI is aimed at making it easy for developers to run popular open-source AI agents from different frameworks and build specialized agents of their own. No matter where the agents originated, or what code they were written in, they can be easily configured to work alone, or with AI teammates, through the IBM Research-designed agent communication protocol (ACP). The ACP standardizes how agents talk to each other, removing one of the main barriers to developing multiagent systems . “Right now, agent-to-agent communication is challenged by inconsistent agent interfaces,” said Kate Blair, the director of product incubation at IBM Research who oversees BeeAI. “ACP will act like a universal connector, providing a standardized way for them to exchange information and interact with other systems.\" The initial BeeAI experiment was geared toward business users, but BeeAI was revamped earlier this year to focus on developers. Its new goal is to streamline the process of finding, integrating, and orchestrating AI agents, no matter which framework or programming language those agents were built in. The protocol underlying BeeAI that makes this all possible is built on Anthropic’s model communication protocol (MCP). Introduced last November, the MCP has standardized how agents connect to tools and data to interact with and accomplish tasks in the real world. IBM’s ACP takes things a step further by introducing the ability to discover and run agents. ACP is currently in the “pre-alpha” stage, as IBM researchers rally the open-source community to build out the protocol to make it easier to discover agents, delegate tasks, and improve agent-to-agent operability. ACP is expected to soon be independent of MCP. Through BeeAI, users can try out some of the most popular open-source agents on the Web with two commands in the command line interface or a click in the UI. Current offerings include widely used open-source agents like Aider , a pair programmer for editing code, and GPT-Researcher , an agent for gathering and organizing research and citations. There’s even an agent for turning research into structured podcasts optimized for AI-driven text-to-speech to dialogue. On Friday, Blair showed off BeeAI at the AI Dev 25 conference in San Francisco with Ismael Faro, distinguished engineer at quantum and AI at IBM Research. Hosted by Coursera and DeepLearning.AI founder, Andrew Ng, the conference draws hundreds of developers each year. “We want to open the discussion, and help move the community toward a universal standard,” said Faro. “We also want to take a feature-driven approach.” Check out the project on GitHub and read the draft ACP proposal .

However, specifying their parameters (such as models, tools, and orchestration mechanisms etc,.) and debugging them remains challenging for most developers. To address this challenge, we present AUTOGEN STUDIO, a no-code developer tool for rapidly prototyping, debugging, and evaluating multi-agent workflows built upon the AUTOGEN framework. AUTOGEN STUDIO offers a web interface and a Python API for representing LLM-enabled agents using a declarative (JSON-based) specification. It provides an intuitive drag-and-drop UI for agent workflow specification, interactive evaluation and debugging of workflows, and a gallery of reusable agent components.

Prerequisites: OpenAI Configuration Details Creating your First Agent workflow in AutoGen, using AutoGen Studio Steps: Running the Program: Scenario 1: Scenario 2: Flow Explanation Take aways Conclusion What’s Next? Multi-agent orchestration frameworks To get started with AutoGen , let’s first recap the Orchestration Framework, its necessity, and other relevant details. Refer to my previous post Unlock the Power of AI: Creating Your First AI Agent Using Semantic Kernel to understand what an AI Agent is, what Multi-Agent systems are, and how to get started with Azure AI Agent services. Once you review that, you’ll grasp the need for an Orchestration layer and how Azure AI Agent Service integrates seamlessly with multi-agent orchestration frameworks compatible with the Assistants API, such as AutoGen and Semantic Kernel. It’s recommended to start by building reliable and secure singleton agents with Azure AI Agent Service . Then, orchestrate these agents using AutoGen , which evolves to find optimal collaboration patterns. Features that prove valuable in production with AutoGen can be transitioned to Semantic Kernel for stable, production-ready support. Now, let’s shift our focus to AutoGen , a framework crafted to identify optimal collaboration patterns and stimulate ideation. What is AutoGen? AutoGen is an advanced framework designed for creating multi-agent AI applications that can operate autonomously or in collaboration with humans. This innovative tool simplifies the development of complex multi-agent conversation systems through two main steps: Defining Agents : Users can specify a set of agents, each with specialized capabilities and roles tailored to specific tasks. Interaction Behavior : Users can define how these agents interact with one another, determining the appropriate responses when an agent receives messages from another. These steps are both intuitive and modular, allowing for the reuse and composition of agents across different applications. Code Generation, Execution, and Debugging: For instance, in building a system for code-based question answering, one can design agents and their interactions as illustrated in the image below. Example Workflow The above image demonstrates a workflow addressing code-based question answering within supply-chain optimization: Commander : Receives user questions and coordinates with other agents. Writer : Crafts the necessary code and provides interpretations. Safeguard : Ensures safety protocols are followed before execution. The process involves multiple interactions: The user submits a question to the Commander. The Commander logs the question and forwards it to the Writer. The Writer generates code based on the question. The Safeguard reviews the code for safety clearance. Upon clearance, the Commander executes the code and provides an answer to the user. This cycle repeats until a satisfactory answer is provided or a timeout occurs. Benefits Using AutoGen significantly reduces manual interactions—by up to 10 times—and coding effort by more than fourfold in applications such as supply-chain optimization. By leveraging AutoGen, developers can efficiently build sophisticated AI systems that enhance productivity while ensuring safety and reliability in their operations.

However, it might not be immediately clear when to switch to multi-agents and what the advantages are. Introduction In this lesson, we’re looking to answer the following questions: What are the scenarios where multi-agents are applicable to? What are the advantages of using multi-agents over just one singular agent doing multiple tasks? What are the building blocks of implementing the multi-agent design pattern? How do we have visibility to how the multiple agents are interacting with each other Learning Goals After this lesson, you should be able to: Identify scenarios where multi-agents are applicable Recognize the advantages of using multi-agents over a singular agent. Comprehend the building blocks of implementing the multi-agent design pattern. What’s the bigger picture? Multi agents are a design pattern that allows multiple agents to work together to achieve a common goal . This pattern is widely used in various fields, including robotics, autonomous systems, and distributed computing. Scenarios Where Multi-Agents Are Applicable So what scenarios are a good use case for using multi-agents? The answer is that there are many scenarios where employing multiple agents is beneficial especially in the following cases: Large workloads : Large workloads can be divided into smaller tasks and assigned to different agents, allowing for parallel processing and faster completion. An example of this is in the case of a large data processing task. Complex tasks : Complex tasks, like large workloads, can be broken down into smaller subtasks and assigned to different agents, each specializing in a specific aspect of the task. A good example of this is in the case of autonomous vehicles where different agents manage navigation, obstacle detection, and communication with other vehicles. Diverse expertise : Different agents can have diverse expertise, allowing them to handle different aspects of a task more effectively than a single agent. For this case, a good example is in the case of healthcare where agents can manage diagnostics, treatment plans, and patient monitoring. Advantages of Using Multi-Agents Over a Singular Agent A single agent system could work well for simple tasks, but for more complex tasks, using multiple agents can provide several advantages: Specialization : Each agent can be specialized for a specific task. Lack of specialization in a single agent means you have an agent that can do everything but might get confused on what to do when faced with a complex task. It might for example end up doing a task that it is not best suited for. Scalability : It is easier to scale systems by adding more agents rather than overloading a single agent. Fault Tolerance : If one agent fails, others can continue functioning, ensuring system reliability. Let’s take an example, let’s book a trip for a user. A single agent system would have to handle all aspects of the trip booking process, from finding flights to booking hotels and rental cars. To achieve this with a single agent, the agent would need to have tools for handling all these tasks. This could lead to a complex and monolithic system that is difficult to maintain and scale. A multi-agent system, on the other hand, could have different agents specialized in finding flights, booking hotels, and rental cars. This would make the system more modular, easier to maintain, and scalable. Compare this to a travel bureau run as a mom and pop store versus a travel bureau run as a franchise. The mom and pop store would have a single agent handling all aspects of the trip booking process, while the franchise would have different agents handling different aspects of the trip booking process. Building Blocks of Implementing the Multi-Agent Design Pattern Before you can implement the multi-agent design pattern, you need to understand the building blocks that make up the pattern. Let’s make this more concrete by again looking at the example of booking a trip for a user. In this case, the building blocks would include: Agent Communication : Agents for finding flights, booking hotels, and rental cars need to communicate and share information about the user’s preferences and constraints. You need to decide on the protocols and methods for this communication. What this means concretely is that the agent for finding flights needs to communicate with the agent for booking hotels to ensure that the hotel is booked for the same dates as the flight. That means that the agents need to share information about the user’s travel dates, meaning that you need to decide which agents are sharing info and how they are sharing info . Coordination Mechanisms : Agents need to coordinate their actions to ensure that the user’s preferences and constraints are met. A user preference could be that they want a hotel close to the airport whereas a constraint could be that rental cars are only available at the airport. This means that the agent for booking hotels needs to coordinate with the agent for booking rental cars to ensure that the user’s preferences and constraints are met. This means that you need to decide how the agents are coordinating their actions . Agent Architecture : Agents need to have the internal structure to make decisions and learn from their interactions with the user. This means that the agent for finding flights needs to have the internal structure to make decisions about which flights to recommend to the user. This means that you need to decide how the agents are making decisions and learning from their interactions with the user . Examples of how an agent learns and improves could be that the agent for finding flights could use a machine learning model to recommend flights to the user based on their past preferences. Visibility into Multi-Agent Interactions : You need to have visibility into how the multiple agents are interacting with each other. This means that you need to have tools and techniques for tracking agent activities and interactions. This could be in the form of logging and monitoring tools, visualization tools, and performance metrics. Multi-Agent Patterns : There are different patterns for implementing multi-agent systems, such as centralized, decentralized, and hybrid architectures. You need to decide on the pattern that best fits your use case. Human in the loop : In most cases, you will have a human in the loop and you need to instruct the agents when to ask for human intervention. This could be in the form of a user asking for a specific hotel or flight that the agents have not recommended or asking for confirmation before booking a flight or hotel. Visibility into Multi-Agent Interactions It’s important that you have visibility into how the multiple agents are interacting with each other. This visibility is essential for debugging, optimizing, and ensuring the overall system’s effectiveness. To achieve this, you need to have tools and techniques for tracking agent activities and interactions. This could be in the form of logging and monitoring tools, visualization tools, and performance metrics. For example, in the case of booking a trip for a user, you could have a dashboard that shows the status of each agent, the user’s preferences and constraints, and the interactions between agents. This dashboard could show the user’s travel dates, the flights recommended by the flight agent, the hotels recommended by the hotel agent, and the rental cars recommended by the rental car agent. This would give you a clear view of how the agents are interacting with each other and whether the user’s preferences and constraints are being met. Let’s look at each of these aspects more in detail. Logging and Monitoring Tools : You want to have logging done for each action taken by an agent. A log entry could store information on the agent that took the action, the action taken, the time the action was taken, and the outcome of the action. This information can then be used for debugging, optimizing and more. Visualization Tools : Visualization tools can help you see the interactions between agents in a more intuitive way. For example, you could have a graph that shows the flow of information between agents. This could help you identify bottlenecks, inefficiencies, and other issues in the system. Performance Metrics : Performance metrics can help you track the effectiveness of the multi-agent system. For example, you could track the time taken to complete a task, the number of tasks completed per unit of time, and the accuracy of the recommendations made by the agents. This information can help you identify areas for improvement and optimize the system. Multi-Agent Patterns Let’s dive into some concrete patterns we can use to create multi-agent apps. Here are some interesting patterns worth considering: Group chat This pattern is useful when you want to create a group chat application where multiple agents can communicate with each other. Typical use cases for this pattern include team collaboration, customer support, and social networking. In this pattern, each agent represents a user in the group chat, and messages are exchanged between agents using a messaging protocol. The agents can send messages to the group chat, receive messages from the group chat, and respond to messages from other agents. This pattern can be implemented using a centralized architecture where all messages are routed through a central server, or a decentralized architecture where messages are exchanged directly. Hand-off This pattern is useful when you want to create an application where multiple agents can hand off tasks to each other. Typical use cases for this pattern include customer support, task management, and workflow automation. In this pattern, each agent\\'}, {\\'title\\': \\'Introducing multiagent BeeAI - IBM Research\\', \\'link\\': \\'https://research.ibm.com/blog/multiagent-bee-ai\\', \\'snippet\\': \\'1 天前\\\\u2002·\\\\u2002BeeAI is aimed at making it easy for developers to run popular open-source AI agents from different frameworks and build specialized agents of their own.

If two heads are better than one, imagine what you could do with a dozen or more. That’s the inspiration behind IBM Research’s newly redesigned multiagent experimental platform, Bee AI . BeeAI is aimed at making it easy for developers to run popular open-source AI agents from different frameworks and build specialized agents of their own. No matter where the agents originated, or what code they were written in, they can be easily configured to work alone, or with AI teammates, through the IBM Research-designed agent communication protocol (ACP). The ACP standardizes how agents talk to each other, removing one of the main barriers to developing multiagent systems . “Right now, agent-to-agent communication is challenged by inconsistent agent interfaces,” said Kate Blair, the director of product incubation at IBM Research who oversees BeeAI. “ACP will act like a universal connector, providing a standardized way for them to exchange information and interact with other systems.\" The initial BeeAI experiment was geared toward business users, but BeeAI was revamped earlier this year to focus on developers. Its new goal is to streamline the process of finding, integrating, and orchestrating AI agents, no matter which framework or programming language those agents were built in. The protocol underlying BeeAI that makes this all possible is built on Anthropic’s model communication protocol (MCP). Introduced last November, the MCP has standardized how agents connect to tools and data to interact with and accomplish tasks in the real world. IBM’s ACP takes things a step further by introducing the ability to discover and run agents. ACP is currently in the “pre-alpha” stage, as IBM researchers rally the open-source community to build out the protocol to make it easier to discover agents, delegate tasks, and improve agent-to-agent operability. ACP is expected to soon be independent of MCP. Through BeeAI, users can try out some of the most popular open-source agents on the Web with two commands in the command line interface or a click in the UI. Current offerings include widely used open-source agents like Aider , a pair programmer for editing code, and GPT-Researcher , an agent for gathering and organizing research and citations. There’s even an agent for turning research into structured podcasts optimized for AI-driven text-to-speech to dialogue. On Friday, Blair showed off BeeAI at the AI Dev 25 conference in San Francisco with Ismael Faro, distinguished engineer at quantum and AI at IBM Research. Hosted by Coursera and DeepLearning.AI founder, Andrew Ng, the conference draws hundreds of developers each year. “We want to open the discussion, and help move the community toward a universal standard,” said Faro. “We also want to take a feature-driven approach.” Check out the project on GitHub and read the draft ACP proposal .
