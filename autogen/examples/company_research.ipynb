This impressive performance was driven by a combination of factors, including strategic capacity adjustments and sustained strong demand for air travel. Profitability: The airline reported GAAP net income of $590 million in the fourth quarter and $846 million for the full year, translating to earnings per diluted share of $0.84 and $1.24, respectively. Strong Cash Flow: American Airlines generated $4 billion in operating cash flow throughout the year, culminating in a record $2.2 billion in free cash flow. Debt Reduction: The company successfully reduced its total debt by $15 billion from peak levels, achieving this goal a full year ahead of schedule. American Airlines CEO Robert Isom expressed his satisfaction with the airline’s full-year performance. “The American Airlines team achieved a number of important objectives in 2024. We continue to run a reliable operation, and we are reengineering the business to build an even more efficient airline.” He further emphasized the positive impact of these efforts on the airline’s strong financial performance in the fourth quarter.

This increased by 2.0% compared to the same period in 2023. Notably, American Airlines led U.S. network carriers in year-over-year domestic, Atlantic, Pacific, and total passenger unit revenue during the fourth quarter.

Margins: Fourth-quarter GAAP operating margin was 8.3%, while full-year operating margin was 4.8%. Adjusted operating margins were 8.4% and 6.0%, respectively. Revenue Drivers The airline attributed its record revenue performance to capacity adjustments and strong demand across its network.

Strategic Milestones Co-Branded Credit Card Partnership: American announced an exclusive 10-year partnership with Citi for co-branded credit cards, aimed at delivering enhanced value for AAdvantage and Citi-branded cardholders. Debt Reduction: The company achieved its goal of reducing total debt by $15 billion from peak levels in mid-2021, one year ahead of schedule. This effort positions American closer to its target credit rating of BB. Liquidity and Balance Sheet American ended the year with $10.3 billion in total available liquidity, including cash, short-term investments, and undrawn credit facilities. The strong free cash flow generation enabled the company to further bolster its financial position, with a focus on continued debt reduction. Looking Ahead With record revenue, improved margins, and significant progress in deleveraging, American Airlines enters 2025 on solid financial footing. The airline’s strategic initiatives, including its partnership with Citi and continued operational adjustments, are expected to position it for sustained growth and profitability. Robert Isom, American’s CEO said: “The American Airlines team achieved a number of important objectives in 2024. “We continue to run a reliable operation, and we are reengineering the business to build an even more efficient airline. “That, coupled with our commercial actions, resulted in strong financial performance in the fourth quarter. “As we look ahead to this year, American remains well-positioned because of the strength of our network, loyalty and co-branded credit card programs, fleet and operational reliability, a nd the tremendous work of our team.” Share × Create an account Sign In Email Address * User Password * Your registration will include editorial emails and offers from EVA International Please do not send me editorial emails Please do not send me offers By creating an account, I agree to the terms of service, and privacy policy Create Account Remember Me Lost your password?
